# Blind-Guiding-Mobile-Robot-Project-based-on-Pioneer3-DX
It's the senior design project I did in University of Detroit Mercy from 2017 to 2018, based on Pioneer3-DX robot platform with Kinect2, Hokuyo. 
This project conclude some open-spurce algorithm I found in github contains SLAM-gmapping, pocketsphinx and so on. Thanks for the providers!(I will try to find the source and add the link.) The robot contain basic mapping and navigation functions, with addtional model in simulation software, voice control and voie feedback, set tarket with coordinate and so on.
Finally, thanks for my teamates, Hao Lan, Yuchen Luo, Diwen Miao and Wuxin Shen. The memory with you I spent on this project is the best period of time of my undergraduate life.

I roughly upload the whole workspace and I think you will be clear with how it work if you are already familar with ROS. And if not, maybe it is a good idea for you to check the catkin_ws/src/hunter/lacunh first. And I will add more description in README later. I know it is not so clear, if youn need help ,feel free to contact with me,  my email is donaldmyshen@outlook.com!
