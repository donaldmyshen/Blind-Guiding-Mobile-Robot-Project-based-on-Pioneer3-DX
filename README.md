# Blind-Guiding-Mobile-Robot-Project-based-on-Pioneer3-DX
It's the senior design project I did in University of Detroit Mercy from 2017 to 2018, based on Pioneer3-DX robot platform with Kinect2, Hokuyo. This project conclude some open-spurce algorithm I found in github contains SLAM-gmapping, pocketsphinx and so on. Thanks for the providers! The robot contain basic mapping and navigation functions, with addtional model in simulation software, voice control and voie feedback, set tarket with coordinate and so on. Finally, thanks for my teamates, Hao Lan, Yuchen Luo, Diwen Miao and Wuxin Shen.
